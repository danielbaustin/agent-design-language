Issue: 5872

Repository: danielbaustin/agent-design-language

Card: stp

Status: ready

## Task

Implement bounded signed resource-weather observations for placement without converting telemetry into authority.

## Deliverables

- Implement bounded signed resource-weather observations for placement without converting telemetry into authority.
- Focused positive and negative tests
- Digest-bound execution proof
- Reviewed rollback evidence

## Acceptance

1. Implement only the declared exclusive paths
2. Preserve Guardian, authentication, bounds, determinism, durability, and redaction invariants
3. Run the exact named test with nonzero test enforcement
4. Prove applicable stale, replay, malformed, unauthorized, failure, and recovery cases
5. Bind all evidence to the exact source revision and artifact digests
6. Complete independent review and child-owned typed closeout
