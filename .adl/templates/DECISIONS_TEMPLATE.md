# Decisions Template

## Metadata
- Milestone: `{{milestone}}`
- Version: `{{version}}`
- Date: `{{date}}`
- Owner: `{{owner}}`

## How To Use
- Add one row per significant decision (architecture, scope, release process).
- Record rationale and tradeoffs at decision time, not after the fact.
- Link to the issue/PR where the decision is implemented.

## Decision Log
| ID | Decision | Status | Rationale | Alternatives Considered | Impact | Link |

| D-02 | `{{decision_2}}` | `{{accepted_or_deferred}}` | `{{rationale_2}}` | `{{alternatives_2}}` | `{{impact_2}}` | `{{link_2}}` |

## Open Questions
- `{{open_question_1}}`
- `{{open_question_2}}`

## Exit Criteria
- All milestone-critical decisions are logged with rationale.
