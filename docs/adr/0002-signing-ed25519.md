# ADR 0002: Signing Model (Ed25519)

## Status
Accepted (v0.5)

## Decision
ADL signing/verification uses Ed25519 with deterministic canonicalization:
- top-level `signature` is excluded from signed bytes
- canonical JSON envelope is recursively key-sorted
- run-time signature enforcement is enabled by default for v0.5 `--run`

## Rationale
Ed25519 provides compact signatures and straightforward verification behavior.
Canonicalization ensures stable bytes for repeatable signing and tamper checks.

## Alternatives Considered
- RSA-based signatures
- Pluggable multi-algorithm support in v0.5
- Optional default enforcement for unsigned runs

## Consequences
- v0.5 scope stays minimal and deterministic.
- Advanced policy features (key rotation, trust stores, richer policy surface)
  are deferred to follow-on milestones.
- Operators can use explicit development override where unsigned runs are
  intentionally allowed.
