# ADL Input Card

Semantic role: Structured Issue Prompt (`SIP`).
Canonical Template Source: `docs/templates/prompts/1.0.3/sip.md`

Task ID: issue-<issue_padded>
Run ID: issue-<issue_padded>
Version: <version>
Title: <title>
Branch: <branch>
Card Status: <card_status>
Generated: <timestamp>

Context:
- Issue: <issue_url>
- PR:
- Source Issue Prompt: <source_issue_prompt>
- Docs: <docs_context>
- Other: none

## Agent Execution Rules
- This issue is not started yet; do not assume a branch or worktree already exists.
- Do not run `pr start`; use the current issue-mode `pr run` flow only if execution later becomes necessary.
- Do not delete or recreate cards.
- Do not switch branches unless explicitly instructed.
- Do not work on `main`.
- Only modify files required for the issue.
- Use repository-relative paths; avoid absolute host paths.
- Write the output record to the paired local task bundle `sor.md` path.
- If repository state is unexpected, stop and ask before attempting repository repair.

## Lifecycle Semantics
- Lifecycle stage: `SIP`
- Activation state: active after issue-intent review.
- Next stage: `STP`, where the selected task or solution is made explicit.
- Downstream planning path: `STP -> SPP -> VPP -> SRP -> SOR` once execution planning becomes concrete.
- Legacy compatibility: older references may call this an input card, but new issue work should treat it as the Structured Issue Prompt.

- Sandbox / approvals:
- Source issue-prompt slug: <slug>
- Required outcome type: <required_outcome_type>
- Demo required: <demo_required>

## Goal

## Acceptance Criteria

## Inputs

## Target Files / Surfaces

## Validation Plan

## Demo / Proof Requirements

## Constraints / Policies

- Follow `AGENTS.md`.
- Use workflow-conductor for lifecycle routing.
- Edit cards only with editor skills.
- Work only in the bound issue worktree after `pr run`.
- Keep validation focused on the touched surface.

## System Invariants (must remain true)

- Deterministic execution for identical inputs.
- No hidden state or undeclared side effects.
- Artifacts remain replay-compatible with the replay runner.
- Trace artifacts contain no secrets, prompts, tool arguments, or absolute host paths.
- Artifact schema changes are explicit and approved.

## Reviewer Checklist (machine-readable hints)
```yaml
determinism_required: true
network_allowed: false
artifact_schema_change: false
replay_required: true
security_sensitive: true
ci_validation_required: true
```

## Card Automation Hooks (prompt generation)
- Prompt source fields:
  - Goal
  - Required Outcome
  - Acceptance Criteria
  - Inputs
  - Target Files / Surfaces
  - Validation Plan
  - Demo / Proof Requirements
  - Constraints / Policies
  - System Invariants
  - Reviewer Checklist
- Generation requirements:
  - Deterministic output for identical SIP content
  - No secrets, tokens, or absolute host paths in generated prompt text
  - Preserve traceability back to the source issue prompt
  - Preserve explicit required-outcome and demo/proof requirements

## Instructions to the Agent
- Read this file.
- Read the linked source issue prompt before starting work.
- Do not create a branch or worktree from this card alone.
- When execution is approved, run the repo-native issue-mode `pr run` flow and then perform the work described above.
- Write execution outcome truth to the paired `sor.md` file during execution.
