Execution Record Requirements:
- The output card is a machine-auditable execution record.
- All sections must be fully populated. Empty sections, placeholders, or implicit claims are not allowed.
- Every command listed must include both what was run and what it verified.
- If something is not applicable, include a one-line justification.

## Summary

Pre-run output scaffold initialized during issue-wave opening. No implementation has started yet.

## PVF Lane Truth
- Initial PVF lane: `<initial_pvf_lane>`
- Planned PVF lane: `<planned_pvf_lane>`
- Final PVF lane: `<final_pvf_lane>`
- Lane change reason: `<lane_change_reason>`

## Issue Metrics Truth
- Estimated elapsed seconds: `<estimated_elapsed_seconds>`
- Actual elapsed seconds: `<actual_elapsed_seconds>`
- Estimated total tokens: `<estimated_total_tokens>`
- Actual total tokens: `<actual_total_tokens>`
- Estimated validation seconds: `<estimated_validation_seconds>`
- Actual validation seconds: `<actual_validation_seconds>`
- Goal metrics data source: `<actual_metrics_data_source>`
- Goal metrics source ref: `<actual_metrics_source_ref>`
- Data-source confidence: `<actual_metrics_confidence>`
- Estimate error percent: `<estimate_error_percent>`
- Issue goal ref: `<issue_goal_ref>`
- Sprint goal ref: `<sprint_goal_ref>`
- Goal metrics rollup ref: `<goal_metrics_rollup_ref>`
- Validation planning prompt: `<vpp_card>`
- Goal-metrics substrate note: consume the `#4264` issue-goal metrics summary when available and record `unknown` instead of duplicating raw session logs here.

## Variance Analysis
- Threshold policy: require variance analysis when any known estimated/actual pair for elapsed seconds, total tokens, or validation seconds differs by more than 10 percent.
- Variance analysis required: `<variance_analysis_required>`
- Variance analysis completed: `<variance_analysis_completed>`
- Variance category: `<variance_category>`
- Variance note: `<variance_note>`
- Sprint rollup guidance: count only completed variance analyses by `Variance category`; keep `not_applicable` out of category totals and never treat unknown metrics as zero variance.

## Artifacts produced
- Local ignored output-card scaffold at `<output_card>`
- Tracked implementation artifacts: not_applicable until execution begins

## Actions taken
- Opened the local issue bundle and wrote a truthful pre-run output scaffold.
- <branch_action>
- Deferred implementation, proof capture, and release integration to the execution lifecycle and PR publication.

## Main Repo Integration (REQUIRED)
- Main-repo paths updated: none
- Worktree-only paths remaining: no tracked implementation artifacts exist yet; execution-time proof surfaces will be established during implementation and PR publication
- Integration state: worktree_only
- Verification scope: main_repo
- Integration method used: local ignored card-bundle scaffold write under the active checkout; tracked implementation artifacts do not exist yet
- Verification performed:
  - `bash adl/tools/validate_structured_prompt.sh --type sor --phase bootstrap --input <output_card>`
    Verified bootstrap SOR contract compliance for the local pre-run scaffold.
- Result: PASS

Rules:
- Final artifacts must exist in the main repository, not only in a worktree.
- Do not leave docs, code, or generated artifacts only under a `adl-wp-*` worktree.
- Prefer git-aware transfer into the main repo (`git checkout BRANCH -- PATH` or commit + cherry-pick).
- If artifacts exist only in the worktree, the task is NOT complete.
- `Integration state` describes lifecycle state of the integrated artifact set, not where verification happened.
- `Verification scope` describes where the verification commands were run.
- `worktree_only` means at least one required path still exists only outside the main repository path.
- Completed output records must not leave `Status` as `NOT_STARTED`.
- By `pr finish`, `Status` should normally be `DONE` (or `FAILED` if the run failed and the record is documenting that failure).

## Validation
- Validation commands and their purpose:
  - `bash adl/tools/validate_structured_prompt.sh --type sor --phase bootstrap --input <output_card>`
    Verified bootstrap SOR contract compliance for the local output scaffold.
- Results:
  - PASS

Validation command/path rules:
- Prefer repository-relative paths in recorded commands and artifact references.
- Do not record absolute host paths in output records unless they are explicitly required and justified.
- `absolute_path_leakage_detected: false` means the final recorded artifact does not contain unjustified absolute host paths.
- Do not list commands without describing their effect.

## Determinism Evidence
- Determinism tests executed: not_run; bootstrap scaffold creation has not been replay-verified for this issue yet.
- Fixtures or scripts used: `adl/tools/pr.sh` issue-wave opening flow.
- Replay verification (same inputs -> same artifacts/order): not yet verified for this specific issue record.
- Ordering guarantees (sorting / tie-break rules used): not_applicable for a single-card bootstrap write.
- Artifact stability notes: repository-relative paths only; execution-time proof artifacts are not expected yet.

## Security / Privacy Checks
- Secret leakage scan performed: limited content review only; no secrets were intentionally recorded in the scaffold.
- Prompt / tool argument redaction verified: not_applicable for bootstrap scaffold generation.
- Absolute path leakage check: repository-relative paths only in the scaffold.
- Sandbox / policy invariants preserved: yes; local ignored issue-record path only.

## Replay Artifacts
- Trace bundle path(s): not_applicable until execution begins
- Run artifact root: not_applicable until execution begins
- Replay command used for verification: not_run
- Replay result: NOT_RUN

## Artifact Verification
- Primary proof surface: this local pre-run SOR scaffold and its bootstrap validation result
- Required artifacts present: local output card scaffold only; tracked implementation artifacts are not expected yet
- Artifact schema/version checks: bootstrap SOR validator passed
- Hash/byte-stability checks: not_run
- Missing/optional artifacts and rationale: execution proofs, demos, and tracked outputs are intentionally absent before implementation begins

## Decisions / Deviations
- Issue-wave opening emits a truthful pre-run SOR scaffold instead of leaving raw template residue for later cleanup.
- Integration state remains `worktree_only` until execution creates tracked artifacts or opens a PR.

## Follow-ups / Deferred work
- Update this record during execution with actual actions, validations, proof surfaces, and integration truth.
- Normalize this record to `pr_open`, `merged`, or `closed_no_pr` during finish/closeout as appropriate.
