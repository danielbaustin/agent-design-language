v0.1 goals and constraints:

- Parse + validate ADL documents.
- Resolve a plan deterministically.
- Assemble prompts deterministically.
- Execute a sequential workflow step with a blocking provider call.
- Concurrency is allowed in the schema but gated in v0.1: concurrent workflows should fail with a clear error message.

Keep dependencies minimal; for local runs, prefer the `ollama` CLI.
