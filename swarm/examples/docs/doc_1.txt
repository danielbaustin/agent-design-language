ADL (Agent Design Language) describes a run, workflow, agents, tasks, and providers in a single YAML document.

Key properties:
- Deterministic resolution: step prompt overrides task prompt, which overrides agent prompt.
- Prompt assembly uses {{variables}} substituted from step inputs.
- Tracing emits StepStarted → PromptAssembled → StepFinished with timestamps and identifiers.

This document is intended as a short “design notes” excerpt for a demo.

v0.1 goals and constraints:

- Parse + validate ADL documents.
- Resolve a plan deterministically.
- Assemble prompts deterministically.
- Execute a sequential workflow step with a blocking provider call.
- Concurrency is allowed in the schema but gated in v0.1: concurrent workflows should fail with a clear error message.

Keep dependencies minimal; for local runs, prefer the `ollama` CLI.
